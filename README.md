This project explores the use of opencv for the AI analysis of plant growth. 
The idea is as follows:
1. Input

 An image of a plant will be uploaded. Necessary details include the species of the plant and stage of plant growth (number of days). --> Look to increase the number of parameters for a more accurate analysis 

 2. Feature extraction

The model will extract the features from the image of the plant.

3. Feature analysis

The model will compare features between the image of the plant and the image of an IDEAL plant at the current stage of growth.

4. Recommendation algorithm

AI analysis of features to recommend tips to grow the plant better
